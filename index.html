<h2>Android Mascot History</h2>
<p class="more-content-history"> 
  The Android logo was designed in 2007 by a graphic designer of Google named Irina Blok.

She revealed that the Android logo was designed to become an international symbol. The choice of the logo required a relationship with the name, then the team decided to dig into some very simple designs or sketches.

The Android Logo’s main element is a robot consisting of a quadrangular torso, semicircular head with two antennas on it, and limbs presented by bars with rounded ends. Irina Blok came up with the symbol as she had received a recommendation from her boss to include a robot in the logo.

Until finally the team chose to use a robot-shaped logo with a muscular body and a head similar to an inverted bowl.

Irina also mentioned that the logo underwent several changes before being designated as the Android icon it is today. The choice of green color is based on the standard color value of the PMS 376C print with hex color # A4C639. Irina explained that green could contrast with almost all colors, especially dark colors.</p>

<h2>first version android</h2>
<p class="more-content-android">
  The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named Dan Morrill. He says he opened Inkscape (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

  The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.

  Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the Bugdroid, the new mascot of Android.

The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office and looked at the restrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.
